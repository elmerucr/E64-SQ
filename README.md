# E64
![E64](./docs/E64_icon.png)
## Description
E64 is a virtual computer system that runs on macOS and linux. It's mainly inspired by the Commodore 64 and implements some Amiga 500 and Atari ST technology as well.
## Technical specifications:
* Main system with 64k ram.
* Custom Video Interface Chip (VICV) with a resolution of 512x288 pixels and a palette of 4096 colors (12bit).
* Custom Blitter Chip with alpha blending capabilities and 16mb video ram.
* Two SID chips (MOS 6581) with stereo mixing possibilities. Each individual SID chip runs at 985248Hz for the same pitch as the chips in the original C64 pal version. Emulation is achieved with the excellent [reSID](http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/crossplatform/emulators/resid/index.html) library by Dag Lem.
* Eight independent and programmable timers.
