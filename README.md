# E64-SQ
![E64](./docs/E64-SQ_icon.png)
## Description
E64-SQ is a virtual computer system that runs on macOS and linux. It's mainly inspired by the Commodore 64 and implements some parts of Amiga 500 and Atari ST technology as well. Unlike the [E64-II](https://github.com/elmerucr/E64-II) system, there's no virtual CPU in inside this system. It uses a kernel written in C/C++.
## Technical specifications:
* Total of 16MB ram.
* Custom Video Interface Chip (VICV) with a resolution of 512x288 pixels and a palette of 4096 colors (12bit).
* Custom Blitter Chip with alpha blending capabilities.
* Two SID chips (MOS 6581) with stereo mixing possibilities. Each individual SID chip runs at 985248Hz for the same pitch as the chips in the original C64 pal version. Emulation is achieved with the excellent [reSID](http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/crossplatform/emulators/resid/index.html) library by Dag Lem.
* Eight independent and programmable timers.

## Compiling
### Core application
#### macOS
* Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode).
* Install the [SDL2 framework].(https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) development library to /Library/Frameworks
* Open the Xcode project in the ./macOS/E64-SQ folder and build the application.
#### Ubuntu Linux / Debian
Run the following commands in a terminal:
````console
$ sudo apt install build-essential cmake git libsdl2-dev
$ git clone https://github.com/elmerucr/E64-SQ
$ cd E64-II && mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
````
Finally, to run the application from the build directory:
````console
$ ./E64-SQ
````
