 * Note: using run(0) function causes the cpu to run only 1 instruction per
 * call. This will increase the overall host cpu load, but also increases
 * accuracy of the system as a whole. Most importantly, SID and VICV emulation
 * will be very realistic. Instant changes to registers should be reflected in
 * audio output.
 * However, run(63) significantly reduces host cpu load, once we have some music
 * running in the virtual machine, test this.
